TwitterAPI 
## Overview
This project is focused on U.S. retail avocado sales by units sold and recent Twitter content with keyword avocado.
The task is to determine relationship between Twitter data and U.S. retail sales data for avocados.
TwitterAPI will be utilized to query avocado content to create data frame.
## Goals
+ Successfully connecting to TwitterAPI
+ Returning filter content by keyword "avocado"
+ Perform EDA - analyzing and visualizing the data using Python libraries Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib
+ Determine relationship between recent avocado twitter content and U.S. retail sales
## Motivation & Background
> This project is interesting to me because I am an avocado consumer and food professional who saw other people answering question with avocado prices and sales volumes data. I don't know if others have investigated a relationship between recent Twitter data and retail sales data specific to avocado. My intent is to use recent Twitter content filtered by keyword avocado by successfully connecting to TwitterAPI. I see potential to assist marketers & sellers to better target their engaged consumers.
