## :avocado: Motivation & Background :avocado:
> This project is interesting to me because I am an avocado consumer and food professional who used avocado prices and sales volumes data for first assignment. I don't know if others have investigated Twitter data specific to avocados. My intent is to gather Twitter content filtered by keyword avocado by successfully connecting to Twitter API. I see the potential to assist marketers & sellers to better target their engaged consumers.
